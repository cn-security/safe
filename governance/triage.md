# Triage

This document talks about the [triage role]() and how it is carried out in
security TAG.  

## Goals of Triage

Security TAG triage aims to ensure that activities, issues and
PRs are given the appropriate attention, and to facilitate the process of
bringing those issues and PRs to fruition. In addition, the triage team assists
in ensuring that STAG governance processes are followed, as well as provide
valuable feedback on how STAG processes can be improved.

## The triage team

The triage team is made out of 1 triage lead as well as any amount of triage 
members that make out the triage team.

### Triage Lead

#### Triage lead responsibilities

The triage lead:
- Ensures that there are enough triage members to handle the volume of issues
  and PRs in the repo. This includes getting new members and handling attrition.
- Ensures that triage work distribution meets the expected amount of time
  required of triage members. (See triage-system partitions)
- Assists in handling request that may need repo privileges of a TL and bringing
  the requests up to a chair if required.
- Helps coordinate the triage members and ensures that triage is being done
  effectively.

#### Triage lead requirements

The triage lead has to:
- Be a co-chair or a TL


### Triage member

#### Triage member responsibilities

Each member of the triage team is responsible for:
- Ensuring that issues/PRs have the approriate labels, so that they can be 
  handled  by the appropriate parties. 
- Ensuring that issues are appropraitely filled out and abide to STAG processes
  and [code of conduct]().
- Ensuring that all issues and PRs have "next steps". This means knowing the
  process of handling certain workflows (e.g. [proposals]()) and indicating
  on the issue/PR on what needs to be done next, tagging the appropriate people
  involved (e.g. chairs/TLs, or a reviewer that has requested changes).
- If there is no work currently being done towards a issue or a PR, there 
  should be progress in terms of an issue or PR's lifecycle. (See [issue/PR
  lifecycle]() below)

#### Why be a triage member?

So why be a member of the triage team? There are many benefits to being part of
the triage team, both in terms of professional development as well as becoming
an integral part of the community.

- **Develop a breadth of knowledge**: Part of being a member of triage
  is to understand the issues and PRs that are being created and ensuring that
  they reach the right audience and are categorized correctly. This provides an
  opportunity to expand one's breadth of knowledge in cloud native security and
  open source governance.
- **Extend your professional network**: Part of being a triage member involves
  getting to reach out to community members, as well as working closely with
  STAG leadership to sort out 
- **Learn how to manage open source**: Being a triage member is like being an
  extension of being a maintainer of a repository. This is a great opportunity
  to learn more about open source management and operation. 
- **Get more involved with the TAG**: Knowing the STAG processes and how to
  handle issues/PRs are also one of several skills are is looked for in the TAG
  leadership if you are aspiring to take on a bigger role in the community.

#### Triage member requirements

Triage members need to:
- Understand STAG processes and governance rules
- Be part of the STAG and have actively participated for at least 3 months
- Be able to dedicate an hour or so each week to help carry out triage duties



## Triage Systems

This section contains information pertaining to how issues are distributed and
picked up by triage members as well as what triage members need to do to handle
the lifecycle of issues/PRs.

### Issue partitions

In order split up and distribute the load on the triage team, triage is split
into several different categories. These categories consists of:

- "Triage-required": The issue is new and needs to be labeled with a category
- "Subcategories": The issue is part of a sub-category, these are such as:
  - "governance": issues related to governance with the "governance" label
  - "security-review": issues related to security reviews denoted by the
    "secrutiy-review" label
  - etc. based on partitioning by triage lead. All categories should
    substantially cover all of the TAG's activities and processes.
- "Unmarked": The issue does not have any of the above labels


These categories are determined by the triage lead, and each triage member is
assigned 1 or more categories. The triage member is only responsible for
performing triage on issues and PRs under their categories assigned.
