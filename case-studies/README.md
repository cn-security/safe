# Case Studies

## Objective

SIG-Security work ought to be informed by data and feedback on what works and what doesn't.
This will help create a feedback loop between the theoretical/hypothetical and practical/tactical.
This falls into 2 categories: process examples (e.g. how well did an assessment go?) and security practices examples (irrespective of the assessment, how are tools working out in the wild?)

## Vision
* Document example case studies, the methodology used, and solicit feedback from participants and consumers - this effort is performed by someone who was not directly participating either as assessor or from the project being assessed.
* Support knowledge-sharing that reduces security risks earlier in the design and implementation cycles across CNCF projects (aka awesomeness!)

# Suggested Case Studies

## Process Case Studies
* OPA Assessment
* in-toto Assessment
* Falco Assessment

## Security Practice Case Studies
* OPA in the Wild
* In-Toto in the Wild
* Falco in the Wild
