# Case Studies

## Objective

SIG-Security work ought to be informed by data and feedback on what works and what doesn't.
This will help create a feedback loop between the theoretical/hypothetical and practical/tactical.
This falls into 2 categories: process examples (e.g. how well did an assessment go?) and security practices examples (irrespective of the assessment, how are tools working out in the wild?)

## Vision
* Document example case studies, both uses of where things went right, and where things went wrong
* Support knowledge-sharing that reduces security risks, providing data about vendors and open source projects
* Define a process for "admission control" for what a case study should look like to add value (not too detailed, not too hand-wavy)

# Suggested Case Studies

## Process Case Studies
* OPA Assessment
* In-Toto Assessment
* Falco Assessment

## Security Practice Case Studies
* OPA in the Wild
* In-Toto in the Wild
* Falco in the Wild
