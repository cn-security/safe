# Security Assessments

## Goals

The [security assessment process](guide) encourages security mindset and suggests a practical 
methodology for conducting a security review. It serves as a living documentation of the project's 
current security related state, background and considerations, it's stated agenda for security, 
and it's communication patterns and security practices.  
The following describe high level goals and motivations the security assessment:

### 1) Reduce risk across the ecosystem

The primary goal is to reduce the risk from malicious attacks and accidental
breaches of privacy. This goal is enabled by the security assessment in two ways:

   * The discussion around the security assessment brings security to the mindset of project maintainers
     who may have otherwise focused on functional achievements
   * Clear and consistent process for communication increases detection &
     reduces time to resolve known or suspected security issues
   * A collaborative critical process led by industry experts increases domain expertise within
     participating projects
   * The assessment gives a measurable security baseline for future reviews

### 2) Accelerate adoption of Cloud Native technologies

The security assessment yields a thoughtful document authored by the project maintainers and reviewed 
by security assessment members. This document enables improved discovery of security information & assists 
in streamlining internal and external security reviews in multiple ways:

   * Consistent documentation reduces review time
   * Established baseline of security-relevant information reduces Q&A
   * Clear rubric for security profile enables potential users to align their risk
     profile with the projectâ€™s risk profile

### 3) Contribute to CNCF processes

The security assessment process has an important role in the ongoing operations of the CNCF and it's 
Technical Oversight Committee (TOC):

   * The CNCF is constantly evaluating the state of the Cloud Native ecosystem and the projects that 
     it produces. A security assessment helps them understand the security background of a project and 
     gain trust in the maturity of a project, having passed a security assessment.  
   * The security assessment is a valuable artifact for projects with aspirations to formally join the CNCF 
     and may be asked to undergo it by the TOC as part of the application process.

## Outcome

Each security assessment shall include a description of:
1. the project's design goals with respect to security
2. any aspects of design and configuration that could introduce risk
3. known limitations, such as expectations or assumptions that aspects of
   security, whole or in part, are to be handled by upstream or downstream
   dependencies or complementary software
4. next steps toward increasing security of the project itself and/or increasing
   the applications of the project toward a more secure cloud native ecosystem

Due to the nature and timeframe for the analysis, *this review is not meant to
subsume the need for a professional security audit of the code*.  Audits of
implementation-specific vulnerabilities, improper deployment configurations, etc.
are not in scope of a security assessment.  A security assessment is intended to
uncover design flaws and to obtain a clear, comprehensive
articulation of the project's design goals and aspirations while documenting the
intended security properties enforced, fulfilled, or executed by said project.

Finalized assessments may be used by the community to assist in contextual evaluation of a  project but are not an endorsement of the security of the project, not a security audit of the project, and do not relieve an individual or organization from performing due diligence and complying with laws, regulations, and policies.

Draft assessments contain *unconfirmed* content and are not endorsed as factual until committed to this repository, which requires detailed peer review.  Draft assessments may also contain *speculative* content as the project lead or security reviewer is performing an evaluation.  Draft assessments are *only* for the purpose of preparing final assessment and are **not** to be used in any other capacity by the community.

Final slides resulting from a project's security assessment will be stored in the individual project's assessment folder with supporting documentation from the assessment.  These folders can be found under [assessments/projects](projects/) and clicking on the project name.

## Process

The security assessment is a collaborative process for the benefit of the
project and the community, where the primary content is generated by the
[project lead](guide/project-lead.md) and revised based on feedback from
[security reviewers](guide/security-reviewer.md) and other members of the SIG.


* If you are interested in a security assessment for your project and you are
  willing to volunteer as [project lead](guide/project-lead.md) or you are a
  SIG-Security member and want to recommend a project to review, please [file an
  issue](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/issues/new?assignees=&labels=assessment&template=security-assessment.md&title=%5BAssessment%5D+Project+Name)

See [security assessment guide](guide) for more details.  To understand how we
prioritize reviews, see [intake process](./intake-process.md).
