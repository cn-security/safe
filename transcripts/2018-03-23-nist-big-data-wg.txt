[00:35.600 - 00:37.700]
Hello, how's it going?

[01:00.000 - 01:03.900]
Okay. Now they have your hello. Hi.

[01:23.700 - 01:45.500]
Good morning, Jason. Thank you. Hear me. Awesome. How's it going? Good, good good.

[01:48.800 - 02:11.400]
Right. So as folks are coming in go ahead and add yourself to.

[02:13.500 - 02:22.000]
Today's minutes drop Lincoln document is also in the calendar invite.

[02:22.700 - 02:30.100]
Jason since I see you driving I can take care of them for you.

[02:34.100 - 02:35.600]
That would be great. Thanks then.

[02:54.500 - 03:13.200]
And of course, I will be looking forward to scribes raise your hand everyone jump on taking notes.

[03:20.900 - 03:21.600]
Thank you, sir.

[03:23.600 - 03:26.500]
grab Market

[03:27.500 - 03:28.900]
work work work

[03:30.900 - 04:12.100]
Do we have another volunteer scribe Christian Jason Rae? This is driving. So don't don't take no chances. Hi Jason. All right. I think I'm supposed to talk with meeting. So one to take that question I could but I cannot figure out how I could see and describe at the same time. I can either see one or the other window. Oh you can make it not full screen. So I usually like make it a little smaller. All right, I ascribe great. So we'll both chime in and then if I miss something you'll catch it. Thank you, Kristen.

[04:17.300 - 04:22.300]
alright, so

[04:26.500 - 05:26.400]
Mark Underwood from this is our presenter today. So definitely want to wait for that excuse the delay. So while we're waiting and everyone's said logging in and getting set up we've grown so much and we're you know, heading towards the TOC and April. So what I want what I go around the the virtual room and you know, just just have everyone introduce themselves. So, you know, the new folks know who's here and the new folks get introductions. So I'll start off. I'm Dan Shaw better known as di saw I come from no just community.

[05:26.500 - 06:26.300]
And I was looking for a place inside the cloud native ecosystem to plug in and leaning on my background in security from my days working for the Department defense plugged into security policy with JJ and Sarah so very happy to be here and facilitating this so I'm going to go around my screen and try not to be too confusing. So Ray, you're the immediate next person on my screen. So can you go next sure. I'm ready Colleen and I've been at Google for about 14 years and I've done various bits of Enterprise pieces throughout my career here and lately the last four years of working on gcp cloud trying to make it more accessible and easier to do policy management for large organizations and recently

[06:26.400 - 06:41.600]
Attention towards kubernetes and trying to do the same thing. They're generally concerned about the administrators, and I have a place in my heart for them and want to make sure that we're doing things right by them. So awesome. Thanks. Did you

[06:44.800 - 07:18.700]
Can you hear me? Yep, I said Jay Jay. This is JJ. I worked in Enterprise. I started off my career in interphase and then worked on infrastructure since 2007 ish with Motorola. Then when Motorola was part of Google's thin build Critters Cloud infrastructure, and then since August have been passionately involved with

[07:20.000 - 07:38.200]
Security as a primary thing and authorization specifically and then created a few effort few initiatives and efforts around it and happy to help out in any way. Thanks excellent question.

[07:41.000 - 08:03.100]
You don't mute. Hi, I'm Christian. I'm work in Google's Cloud security team. I've been working on the I am team for the last two three years, I think and I'm now looking at kubernetes and sto for in particular around authorization policy. But also talk a lot with Ray about policy General but um, sir.

[08:06.400 - 08:31.400]
I had to unmute I am part of Google prior Firebase recently moved to gcp and and working on infrastructure that supports both Firebase rules, which is offer isolation policy and Google Cloud functions, which has its own needs in terms of server lists, and the events that trigger functions awesome Jason.

[08:32.900 - 08:54.700]
All right, Jason mellow with near form previously spent the last four or five years or so over an ATP working on a lot of public cloud cloud native initiatives over there early what soccer kubernetes more recently as well as some involvement on the open tracing side of things.

[08:55.900 - 09:09.000]
Great looking just as good we could have it on board for both about from W so too and so my focus is mostly an Indian access management, and I've been with W2 for more than 10 years now.

[09:10.200 - 09:11.300]
room 3

[09:13.400 - 09:35.000]
sorry, I was on mute. I'm treating meaty and the product lead for identity and access management for the little sprite three products and resources as well. The lately looking into communities. I am as well as steel and how we can leverage those models for physical products.

[09:35.600 - 10:12.600]
Great. Thank you Doug took damage from IBM heading up the team in charge of working on all things Cloud native and you open source Community with obviously the main focus these days on things like kubernetes and is to your professor great gonna butcher this. Yeah issue. Yes, I my name is Leo. I went in the community GK teams. I'm looking to secure enforcement in General on a community cluster.

[10:13.500 - 10:14.700]
excellent

[10:17.300 - 10:19.700]
Fantastic, what did I miss anybody?

[10:21.700 - 11:01.900]
Maybe it so the glaring person that I'm missing is Mark who is our presenter today. So I might need to Pivot from that Branch free. I know you're you've been beginning to work on the the white paper. Maybe we could pivot to sort of introduce everybody to that and check in to see how that's going.

[11:06.000 - 11:07.600]
I think they has done actually.

[11:09.500 - 12:09.100]
Where do you want to do you able to share some of that for us as we wait for work? Sure I can talk about it. I think JJ entry are being very in the amount of effort that they put it on quite a lot of I don't know why they keep nominating me. So I got to figure out how to present here. I have a window and I missed a meeting. So maybe Dan while Ray's getting set up you can just like give an overview of what the context of the white paper. Sorry. I was out of town. Okay. So the white paper again begins to go into building on the use cases that we've been hearing

[12:09.400 - 12:16.700]
And it's taking comes distilling down all of yesterday. Are we recording we are?

[12:17.600 - 13:17.000]
This is a recorded for posterity and I will post that to the meeting. Dr. We all signed in on when we're done. Thank you. Yeah, you bet and now I've got all the the issues worked out with getting getting a zoom set up all good, right? Oh, yeah, Sarah what we what we do is we talked about kind of where to start with this. We wanted to come up with a set of personas, you know, we talked about the Enterprise or administrators Bill of Rights and you know, it was interesting discussion and then various people said, okay. Well, that's cool. What are the different personas and what are their needs? So we wrote the administrators Bill of Rights obviously from the administrators point of view, right and but you know, hey, there's developers and compliance folks and bunch of other things. So Shri and JJ and myself like we kind of went through and through a bunch of

[13:17.500 - 14:17.300]
Into argument to kind of start and you know on my team currently we had to give these people names. So hopefully eventually maybe we'll think we need to start talking about. Hey Charlie. All right grappling. She does this. Let me know our or Gagnon this so hopefully we'll get to know these people and feel affection for them as we go through and you know, create our solution we can always bring up these people and ask how they would experience a certain thing. So the goal is is to Define what these people are these personas what they care about right? And this really should be a group effort everybody here just you know thing me or pink AJ for common access will share it out and you know or and just start suggesting stuff and writing personas in here as you see them and we can we can iterate over time. So this is a living document. This is definitely the first kind of go around and you know what we did we probably missed some so just let us know so

[14:17.500 - 15:17.300]
Overall, we have created this concept of a developer and Enterprise operator a resource Captain Network operator in end user which I find in infrastructure operator or and then compliance security admin and you know third-party security product system. Not sure what that is. I'll have to was new to me. So yeah, so at the end of the day, I want to kind of go into each of these and talk about them. The other thing to consider here is is what angle are we looking at? So Jay and I had an interesting comment thread we said hey is a developer developers are both consumers of resources, and they're also creating resources, right? And so, you know coming from my background. I always think of developers is consuming, you know resources as you know, Google Cloud platform or web services like developers come in and they consume our stuff and they make new stuff right? And so but

[15:17.500 - 16:17.300]
He made a very good point to say, you know developers also create research course. This is thin right there creating programs that create a new Services those sources of those resources and they want to be able to attach and they can take advantage of these policy systems, you know that exist and I think this is where things like, you know what Sarah works on and being able to attach like Firebase rules to things and talk me really interesting from an app developer point of view. So I think we need to consider those to me those sound like two different personas like a developer acting in terms of consumer in a developer acting in terms of creating something both have different needs right and so that was our proposal but so I'll talk about developers consumer because I think it's a little bit more well defined and you know in this in this case here, you know a developer. We put a few things in here write I as a developer, I need to provide logs for any changes to critical resources such as we made available for auditing. So I think this is talking to and from that that

[16:17.400 - 16:17.700]
Tom

[16:19.600 - 17:19.300]
Blue shirt of you. I'm creating stuff. Right and I think as a developer I need to be able to tag my resources so they can be grouped by the administrator when required right? So again, this is talking about for the producer point of view, right? I need to be able to add the generalized tagging that infrastructure. So administrators have one view of might need resources right and and lack and lastly I think as a developer I can I can add policy checks to my resources, right? So, how do we do that? And how do we make that easy? So thinking about developers if I'm living in the ecosystem of the safe world, right? How do I end up integrating with that? And I think you know, that's an interesting Persona and I haven't we haven't written down the developers consumer yet. We'll get there soon. Okay, so Enterprise operators who are these people right? And we tend to think of them on my team. We think of them as Olivia like they're the overall kind of like itthere centralized.

[17:19.500 - 18:19.000]
Use the general you're watching over the entire universe, right? They are generally trying to create a safe environment for all they want safe by default. This is generally where they're coming from. Right and they want to set up a set of stuff for says hey, if you just come into the system you can do stuff you're able to be productive but you've also not but you're also, you know restricted from doing things that would be dangerous to our company dangerous to our branding or store data, right and so operators their goal is to effectively have no people call them, right so if they can set up some of the way so they can basically put the exceptions in place and put everything and everybody is okay and then they don't call for things that are everyday mundane things than the Enterprise operators play, right and they also need to view their system. They need to be able to troubleshoot quickly and they need to be able to take action when when required so, you know, this is a key thing. So an Enterprise operator

[18:19.500 - 19:19.000]
You know, they need a central way to look at all the organization's resources and so they can administer them in a single view implicit in that is the idea that there is no Shadow it right. So anything that gets created must be visible and and you know, people can't go over here and spin up a communities cluster and administered on their own and no one knows it exists. That's the kind of stuff that makes this Enterprise operator gives them a lot of pause. All right as an Enterprise operating the ability to see what has what has changed about a resource when it changed and who changed right? So this gets into audit logging it's about making sure that we are reporting and have easy ways to understand the state of the system and how it got there and this is especially important during incidents, right both outages and in security incidents a lot of times policy changes and config changes cause outages so knowing who and when they changes were made you can lot of times use those to to

[19:19.500 - 20:19.400]
Recover from outages. It's also good for you know, incident response and and certification. All right PCI in particular is very clear about needing to know who has access to what right improve it as an Enterprise opportunity to way to delegate my policy control to lower level admins who can help me scale again Enterprise operators at the top level are trying to get themselves never be called. So they want to be able to delegate stuff to lower level admins who have more knowledge about what's going on. So, you know, we talked to Costco a while back and one of the things that they were always afraid of is look, you know at the top level happens when someone calls us to change a bit. We're so far removed from that bit that we have no idea what it does and it gives us a lot of anxiety. So by being able to delegate to people who actually understand what those bits do that is a very important feature to efficiency and to safety. All right, and then as Enterprise operator, I need to away denominator.

[20:19.400 - 21:12.300]
Our policy type operators both at the higher level and lower levels, right? So the Enterprise operators kind of the root operator, you can think of them as root in your company. They lots of times take on many hats right? Sometimes the quota people sometimes to the access control people sometimes of the network happens, but in a big or that's too much for one person to do so, they need a way to say. Hey Dan is the network operator in this company and he has the network operator privilege at the root level. And hey shree is the is the quota resource captain and you know, she's able to determine spend and quotas for you know the company and so it's both a horizontal skin, but it's also a vertical scaling in terms of like, okay Dan is the you know is the network operator for the you know, YouTube division right or something of that sort. Cool, by the way, stop me anytime if anything's are controversial.

[21:12.800 - 22:12.700]
Hey Ray, may I ask one question? Yeah, when talking about the operators in a big and price they are belong to the same org, but sometimes they have multiple departments and instead of one department is possible. They will have another a small operation team represent the department. So is there any distinguish between busy busy I'm asking if there's another Division I between the operators from different departments. Yeah, that's a good question. You sweet the the this particular bullet here. I need a way to delegate policy control the lower level admins who helped me scale. So the idea here is you'll have a departmental operator. Right? And that operator can be given full control over their compartment. Right? And and this is something we talk about the administrators Bill of Rights. All right, the fact that like you as an as an admin can compartmentalize your resources.

[22:12.800 - 22:40.200]
And then you and you can act autonomously right? So it it means that the Enterprise partner can give full rights away to you as a lower-level operator and in a department and they could say you have the power to make exceptions and you have the power to be able to do this or you don't right depending on the corporate policy. Does that help? Yep, I see. Thank you. Okay, so it could we express that is lower level admins including other Enterprise operators.

[22:41.100 - 23:37.100]
Yeah, you can say including you know, so in prison. All right, so you you you mentioned here. You know Shadow IIT is is it relevant to our use cases to you know to have any sort of exploration of resources in or out so, you know the assumption that there there no Shadow resources ever is a fallacy right there. There's there's probably going to be something somewhere created by some team or you know acquisition where things are going to get Incorporated in is that relevant to we need to have visibility into the resources to apply policy to it.

[23:37.400 - 24:37.200]
Yeah, so the way I think about that is is that the Enterprise operator think of the route, you know draws a rectangle and says this is the universe right and the universe might be a you know, just to get down to brass tacks a set of networks set of DNS domains, right, you know a set of you know, kind of cloud provider set up to use those networks, right and shared out and I think within that rectangle we do not want people to be able to create things and hide them right now. Will you describe like a choir a company who has another whole deployment somewhere else there outside the rectangle, right? And so therefore if they have their own DNS names they have their own networks and things like that, you know, they, you know, eventually we'll want to become part of the rectangle, but they can be protected through the through, you know, the base the base components of security right and firewalls and DNS and things of those sort like, you know, for example someone in chat

[24:37.300 - 25:37.200]
He can never expose something. Let's say on google.com. Right but they just can't right and the only way to expose something on Google accounts to be within the rectangle. Right? Those are the types of ways that I think was that help. Yep. That's terrific. Thank you. Okay, cool. Okay, so we can we can move on now. I think you know the concept here is when we get into the Enterprise operator and we started talking about like per policy type operators, right? We can start thinking of who these like per policy type operators are and so one of them is the resource captive, right? And and the reason why I particularly like this one is because I think it's pretty easy in in authorization to really concentrate on access control lists, right and and and also like, you know filtering on labels and things like that, but another form of authorization and policy is quota policy, right? It's about are you authorized to be able to you know create another?

[25:37.300 - 26:37.200]
Via are you authorized to be able to create more users right? These things are controlled by quota policy. Right? And so a resource Captain is the is the person who is delegated to to manage that for an organization and similar to all of the things that Enterprise operator has the ability to see stuff and delegate and and that policy resource Captain's need the same thing for their their purview which is which is quota so we can you know, we can talk about that but I think you know as a resource Captain, you know a constraint how many resources a set of teams is able to use I need to be able to delegate research quota management just sub captains, right, you know as a resource Cafe need to be alerted if resource code of allocation exceeds a certain amount right people go out us back and and again, I think you know, it's interesting putting these things into the equation helps us think a little bit bigger than just than we can get through.

[26:37.300 - 27:37.200]
Is there anything else besides quota that the resource kept in their story about should be call him quota operator to to stay with you know, nomenclature that we yeah, we could we could do that good. I didn't know I'd ask that question, right? You know, what what it what does it mean to be a resource Captain? Oh, yeah, actually I want to ask the same question. Actually, I'm thinking about something more than the resource quota and access control, especially in communities. There's another kinds of how to call it. I'd like to call it like a resource privilege. Like you can create a port with certain privilege of capability some some capability of privilege will be harmful to the system like a privileged containers comes of I'm not sure if this falls into this category so I don't see them as a quote Opera.

[27:37.200 - 28:37.000]
What what I just heard described there is more of like a constraint right? So you think about this. This is popular in Windows. Right? Like you can do you can say things like Windows users are not allowed to example change their IP right and it you know on these machines and they're like straight policies that even though you're an administrator of the domain has prevented you through domain policy from doing certain things on your Windows machine, right and what I think you just described is the idea that a cluster admin right can say something like hey, you know you as a name space pod Creator you can create pods but these pods have to have the following characteristics. Is that true? Yeah. So, okay. What was I saying? Is this foes to a different category? Yeah. This is more of like constraint policies or things of that sort. I don't know what the generic category if anyone here who has a lot of politics brings knows what those things are called I'd

[28:37.200 - 29:19.600]
You know, we call them in gcp we call them organization policies. You know, I think you know Windows has its own domain policies and things like that. So that's a very important use case and it's actually one that I think Firebase rules is really good at right, you know, I think what they do is they look at every incoming requests and they can invalidate the map right of the of the object and then it says hey if this thing's in the this object then kick it out, right and that's on top of authorization like access check. So it's like yeah you sweetie has the way has the ability to to create pods. But if the top spec doesn't look like this, we're going to kick it out.

[29:20.200 - 29:48.800]
Right some good. And and I think the question we have to ask ourselves is is that a separate policy type of the separate policy type of operator, right or is it part of the access control system and those who great ACLS are the ones who create these types of constraints? And and I think that that's a raging debate right? I think in kubernetes, that's what the mission controllers to write. So ever whoever sets up the admission control of would be responsible for that.

[29:50.500 - 30:50.400]
You have to create a custom in Mission Control, right? Yeah. Yeah, but that thing could you could you could have it extend our back and read our back policies with conditions, right? Yes. So yeah something that that as we're preparing this that may be useful, you know, I'm reticent to you know, create new nomenclature. Right? What we're doing is capturing, you know context so if we have these implementation separate implementation in kubernetes or whatever if we can footnote these sections with in kubernetes that you know, this is called this and you know done how then I think will be very

[30:50.500 - 31:46.700]
You know setting ourselves up for success as we navigate the name bashing that will invariably take place. I wanted to interrupt for a second. I think that's a great idea. Dan mark under word is here and we're at the half-hour Mark and maybe we can switch gears and pick this up. But this is a great introduction to the white paper. Just wanted to chime in with that. If you want to go back to the originally scheduled presentation. Thank you, sir. And Mark, let's have an open discussion around that. I know you have one of your peers inside of Mystic couldn't make it today. So we could we could actually take this either way. We can give you the floor and you know have the the miss presentation now or we can reschedule that and continue raising the groove so

[31:47.200 - 31:49.700]
Do you think Mark?

[31:55.100 - 32:42.300]
Sorry too many conferences. I've been in today though. I'm switching platforms for the fourth time. So look at this. I'm ready to go with this and I can live in this constraint timeframe constraint. So I have a deck if you want to let me share great so you can find the screen sharing. I think it's the big green thing the bottom of your screen and zoom. So let's go ahead and switch over to that. Why don't Rea why don't you drop a link to to the use case stock into into chat and into the minutes and we'll pick that up next week and continue that that's looking really good. Thank you, sir.

[32:45.700 - 33:45.400]
All right. So Mark, we went through everybody introducing themselves at the beginning of the session before you get started into the details. Be nice to just introduce yourself and share a little bit about yourself. Yeah. Sure. So I'm I work in controls and countermeasures and synchrony synchrony is a sort of a spin-off of ge's Retail Finance group. It's a big company. I think we're Fortune 140 or so prior to that. I've been working and health informatics and I'm pretty involved in these in the ontology space mostly on a volunteer basis. I co-chaired the 2015 conference on ontology. She's for iot. I have a book chapter out and on security for iot. So that's kind of my interest in it.

[33:46.000 - 34:45.400]
This big data group that I'm going to give you the an overview of today started working in 2015. I'm one of about 15 or 20. So it's really a pretty small group. Not much bigger than the one that we're in now that's been working on big data and basically just trying to give this team some ideas of the things we worried about in that group. And what's a little different from some of the other standards group. This is not a standard. It's just a special report. So it's not telling people how to do things. It's more like background on this. Oh, I forgot to mention one other thing. So I'm also pretty engaged with IEEE working groups for devops security. That's 2675 and a sweet if you want to call them that of the 7000 series which is trying to deal with ethical issues. So there's some overlap with security and privacy issues and Providence for

[34:45.900 - 35:12.600]
Traceability of responsibility for Matthew look at this Facebook issue that's out that people are looking at as a security issue. It really is more of a traceability and Providence and Trust Federation kind of issue, which is really wish people were calling it a big data problem instead of the security problem, but that's okay. You don't govern you don't own the public discourse on this so it will get this screen.

[35:15.300 - 35:19.300]
I think I'm still part of the screen. Is that me or everybody?

[35:21.700 - 35:26.900]
I can make it smaller. Oh, no, I'm that was me. Okay, that's good.

[35:29.100 - 35:50.200]
Right. So the homepage has the URL for this work and all the documents that are in draft or available directly with download don't have to sign in for anything. That's one thing about nist of we're paying for that with our taxpayers not through the contributions of members like some other public working group. So that's that's one of the advantages.

[35:52.200 - 36:19.900]
So the where the second draft it's a multi-volume Enterprise, I forget how long it is, but it's pretty long. I'm really just talking in this venue about the security and privacy work and I'm going to give you a taste at the end of this and we just see where we are in time. That's laughter five after the hour. I'll try to stop by a quarter after and show you a few pages out of the document that I think are relevant the Lagoon.

[36:21.700 - 37:17.800]
So this special report that's in draft is already gone through public comment. We didn't actually get a whole lot which is unfortunate, but it's now going through review at at nist. They've got some things they want us to make changes to but I expect it'll be released for the public and early summer at the latest if not sooner. So the strength of what we've done in volume for anyway of this is that we've been at it for a while. So we've gone through a few Cycles like kubernetes didn't even exist at the beginning of this and 2013. I mean it existed probably internally somewhere but it wasn't in the common discourse very much then at least not in our working groups. So it's been around seen a few product cycles. And that's been good. We also have seen the emergence of iot during that time that really wasn't part of the discourse so much then that's a good thing for reasons. I think all become clear later here.

[37:18.300 - 37:56.200]
We tried to make it light wake I lightweight not too regimented. It doesn't say you have to go to Cloud to do everything even though there's a realistic aspect of this that if you're a relatively small organization, you probably are going to do all this in the cloud anyway, and there is a uniform reference model even though it's very light way to deals with I'll show you a picture of that later on. So that's a benefit. Maybe we mainly because some of the the draft writers don't use the same language across all the documents. So it gets hard to know in the security document what's being referred to in the architecture side.

[37:57.400 - 38:57.300]
Interesting the weaknesses of the documents are kind of all the same things because it's mature doesn't have the latest stuff the vendor neutrality often hide. Some of the use cases that are the really interesting ones kubernetes is sort of example of that but you know me so since some of the other orchestration challenges that our product specific are really good ones to wrestle with being lightweight can be a problem. It's not because it's not a standard. It's not going to change people's behavior and how they build build things and a lot of the the less technical people involved in this working group because it wasn't just technology people. There are very concerned about the sort of thing that happened with Facebook this week last weekend the public disclosure, but of course what happened in 2016 with that and in fact, they talked about it so much. We got sick of hearing about it from them. We thought we'd addressed it. But you know, I think we never fully satisfied the relatively late.

[38:57.300 - 39:57.200]
Public's concerns about protections put around public data in the for the folks whose public whose business models are built around consent driven use of data and the reference models pretty simplistic. You know, I think this group will probably find a dismissive or dismissible but that's okay least we know it is so we think there's some things that are different about Big Data most maybe the key thing is that multiple security schemes have to be addressed. You're looking at attack vectors That Vary depending on Whose organization. It is countermeasures are not going to be the same for small companies compared to big companies the people that originated the data or collated may not be the same institution that he's going to deploy it. There's a sensibility about how to deal with sensors that people who haven't worked in real time systems are not aware of Real Time stuff not new in Computing.

[39:57.300 - 40:57.300]
But it's new for a whole generation or two of folks who who basically cut their teeth on transaction driven kind of computing and relatively static database work transaction driven databases. And that's big data forces you to deal with spark and that sort of thing. So that's an important the unintended uses and the anonymization is a key thing that just because you don't have a Social Security number in a row doesn't mean that people can't figure out who you're talking about in your data and so the architecture from sobriety privacy and security point of view need to deal with deonda anonymization that occurs outside of your own organization Downstream when the data is consumed there are lots of problems with scale and complexity Cloud magnifies this obviously you get that with the traceability their veracity the kind of content that you're going to have to manage, you know, we used to call it Balkan and the early days of data.

[40:57.300 - 41:57.200]
This is now Barack stuff is you know, the main thing that's moving on our networks. I think somebody told me that YouTube was if not the most one of the biggest consumers on our internal networks, which I find surprising because I don't I'm not on it all the time. So I don't know who has time to look at it. Yes, there is training stuff on there that's worth having of course and then there's jurisdiction issues that data is shared across continents and that's common not uncommon. And so you have you have multiple jurisdictions that are responsible for the data. So if you're going to share both data and code in your networks across organizations and countries Big Data presents you with problems. You probably didn't anticipate in systems built earlier. Another thing. That's kind of interesting that's is that big data power is now wielded by smaller organizations really small as one person can you know take that 50 million record data set that was floating around from Facebook.

[41:57.200 - 42:57.100]
Do a lot of things with it. That doesn't mean they have no governance, but they tend to be people with weak governance and week training and tend to be unregulated in unregulated settings. Anyway, so the fluffy part of talking about security for for Big Data is that it's affected by all these Dimensions volume velocity variety veracity and volatility and of course Cloud. So I think people on this call, you know, based on my listening to this call. You don't need to be told why this matters but it might be interesting to see if you think through he's one of these and the Frameworks that you're currently using to manage them. You can see what the challenges are that your face and then just multiply that across organizations what's left less fluffy about what has emerged that we tried to worry about is the Big Data aspect of what is going to have to change in the software development life cycle. So agile is part of this the

[42:57.200 - 43:49.300]
API first architecture is part of this little bit. See if you haven't heard that lingo. That's the you know build to a specification first before you write any code because you know, if you need a geolocation service, you probably are going to need to understand how to get data from Google or Microsoft or some other or from you know, a government service that's publishing that microservices and containers are going to be important. I sort of see these as you know, Children of the components and composable services movement, but this is still important it matters because that's this is going to be a new way that we need to manage security software-defined networks and 5G are going to become important because mobile networks are providing this geolocation service. That is one of the d The principle drivers for a DNA on MM ization of data sets.

[43:49.700 - 44:49.300]
Left shift is important because this becomes part of sack cops. So the orchestration of you want to call it that a playbooks to run the tools that you have in the stack in in the security group becomes part of what needs to be coded and we're going to push that responsibility closer to the developers and it was before so people have coined. This is sect of Officer deaths a cops, but it's all kind of that not through the fluffy part of this work to figure out how that needs to work. And how what kinds of Frameworks need to be adopted to to allow that so Chris DM is kind of an interesting use case of a new model driven kind of thing in the health space that produced a lot of unanticipated data sharing and analytical challenges across multiple Industries. It probably is the you know, it's one of those tip of the iceberg kind of things but now of Chris DM has been around for a while. It's a

[44:49.700 - 45:49.400]
Verbal model building thing if you haven't run into that, so I think I already mentioned iot but you know, if you've been around a while this is you know, describe distributed computing writ large with just more fatter pipes and you know more sensors and richer sensors. So the key trends we tried to worry about in the in the draft where where Cloud obviously iot especially as related to health and safety the mobility and presented pervasive Computing. So that's you know metrics that are coming off individual people including you know, the new Voice driven kinds of things but also the geolocation stuff that goes with most of these things the data center automation that's happening where basically, you know, as we're rethinking how we do our stack and rack kind of processes and the way that we build out protected sub-networks inside the data center is now moving into software increasingly. So that's

[45:49.700 - 46:49.600]
Pushing the automation process further down onto the stack with routers and that kind of thing more than it used to be trust and Federation. We try to tackle that a little bit and maybe one of the key things that that I really pushed in. This design was more automation on domain specific processes, either through domain-specific languages or explicit domain models. And then last trend is moving more toward attribute-based access models more than role-based. And reason for that is not the role based it's gone, but that you really can't effectively instrument access controls against only a purely role-based thing. If you have domain based models that are using an attribute based model. So this is a little gets a little involved. But basically if you want to consume an ontology and do that with an Abe that kind of system you're better off using attributes then roll.

[46:49.600 - 47:49.600]
Named the roles can be derived from attributes. So it's a longer nist a paper on this that we that we relied on for this. Hey Mark. Yeah, it has one country regarding the a back my rather than the are back. Can I interpret that as a bag plus a backhand and moving to a back one more so we still need a break right? Well, that's it's like saying can you build something without admin? So I have a standard rant I get into on this but you know, it seems like coders. The first thing they want to do is is build an admin. It's like deciding to build a bridge with that has a guaranteed single point of failure in it. And it's really one of the problems that we face with this that that the architecture of the things we build have role-based things built into them that don't need to be there. And so yeah, they're this unavoidable. You can't you can't have that if you've got an architecture with an admin role in it you now have got

[47:49.600 - 48:49.300]
Deal with it, but I would argue you don't have to have that now how you how you do that, you know depends on the on the domain aspect of that. But yeah, you you can't do one without the other we have Legacy of role-based of controls that are not just in our hardware systems in our operating systems, but in the security Frameworks built around them, it's just unavoidable. Thank you. So and I have just a question. I'm not familiar with your vocabulary. Like what does it mean to consume an ontology? Yeah. I knew I wouldn't get away with that. So an ontology is a model and how you get from an ontology to a model, you know varies a lot. So there's an oasis group that's trying to develop a standard for doing that. So an example of that might be if you have an ontology that allows you to make an inference about logs coming out of Splunk that

[48:49.600 - 49:49.600]
Represent a certain kind of attack. It could be that the log information will tell you that if the ontology tells you which logs to examine which features you know, which of the fields in the logs are the ones that you need to look at because now what's happening if with products like Splunk as you have not just tons of logs by volume but variety so you have many different kinds of logs that need to be looked at in tandem in order to make inferences. So the ontology drives the inferences, but it needs to be ingested by tools like Splunk and and other tools around that in order to know what to look at. So that's one use case for that but there are other ones so I know I got away with saying that by by talking fast here, but that's of course not not not widely deployed. Right? So I guess I I'm trying to connect the dots between that use case which it totally makes sense to me and I would have guessed that. That's what you were talking about.

[49:49.500 - 50:12.100]
How does that relate to a back I can guess but I'd be interested in your rights, you know exactly what so most of the strategies for getting data out of you know rdf or one of the other ontology systems, you know, sort of out of owl are to treat the nodes on these graph models as attributes. So that's how you get into the attribute model.

[50:13.800 - 50:18.800]
But for Access Control, yep, okay, so they're just storing.

[50:19.600 - 51:19.200]
Okay, I think this is a longer conversation always a white paper. Yeah. Well, it is a longer conversation. So yeah, maybe it's more important how we got here. It's for this short conversation and you know, if there's interest more interesting, you know you this team might be able to drive some real solutions that are still floating around in The Ether and limited to academic spaces, you know more than than the practitioner or space that we really would rather be in great. Let's keep going and then we'll Circle back awfully good good though. I mean that's an important topic. So if we have time down the road that's really worthwhile. So influences the drove what we did here the obviously the nist 1853 because of its prevalence not so much the content but the prevalence of its adoption the the building automate there's a smart building ISO standard that uses ontology is as the base for it. So these are and these are public because this particular ISO standard was designed to be public on

[51:19.600 - 52:19.500]
Lot of the iso work. So if you go to this URL, you'll get a sort of background on that. What's interesting to me about this is how you take that obviously and try to do security with it. I mention these other these other ISO standards that are driving some of this work in 2675. This is an emerging standard. We're still I think in 18 months into working on this standard, but it's it's already got a lot of content. That's that might be of interest to this group. I see micro segmentation. And and if V is one of the the main drivers for adding protections, you know, we've all were all dealing with, you know, the notion of zones that goes back probably 15 years, right? But the idea that that at that application developers can control the zones and the micro segmentations in which there are their containers or operate is is a relatively new thing is probably being done in places that

[52:19.600 - 52:44.000]
Just don't know about it yet. And the other influence of course is infrastructure as code. So I think I covered that already. So the use cases that are in the draft cover. So we're doing on time here. I'm over time. So I'm going to go faster. So you'll find these use cases. One of the key use cases for Big Data is Network protection. So if you're if you're having to rent disk space from Splunk, you already know about this.

[52:46.600 - 53:46.500]
Let's see. So what we one of the contributions I think of this report is we give them some we give the users checklist. There's a pretty long bibliography that they can go to that. It's drawn from you know, both academic sources and some industry sources. We did a deep dive on hl7, which is a Health Care standard about how they manage consent give you an idea about that consent problem, you know, the Facebook one is one that's being talked about today. But the bigger problem is you know, how do you give consent for somebody to make decisions about when to pull the cord on you in a hospital setting? What do you do if your your ex-wife you know still has has that consent because you never got around to repealing it. What do you do about information about people that are handicapped in a building that's bring down. Do you do you break the rules about sharing confidential information if it's going to be needed to save their lives so hl7

[53:46.500 - 54:46.300]
Kind of work through a lot of those use cases and we kind of took that into the Big Data space to to list a to flesh out. Our detailed use cases. We came to the conclusion. You can't do big data security without simulation that if you want to scale things up, you got your not going to be given Big Data spaces to operate. So if you're going to do risk management and the availability piece of CIA that you are going to have to do simulations. So that's another reason to have a model driven kind of approach to this and what we did was, you know, try to go after the safety Frameworks like the material data data safety standards, if anyone hears work through that we treat the data elements associated with pii and PCI on the way that people would with material data safety records lastly. We have this notion of the system Communicator, which is a sort of standard.

[54:46.500 - 55:08.400]
Software artifact that needs to be produced in a big data system to allow it to communicate to the various consumers. So if you want to know what when did you you provide consent for us to use your data for this it remembers the whole session associated with you doing that and it has a natural language sort of interface on a public website to do that.

[55:09.700 - 56:09.500]
So I'm going to skip these diagrams and interest of time we can come back to this but I want to show you is the what we did with the these safety conformance levels. So these conformance levels are people who choose to do. So can look at this document and say we're attempting, you know, based on a self-assessment to follow a safety level of 1 2 or 3. According to this nice big data security standard. So at the highest level which is what I think this group might want to be interested in is that it looks at automated use of these domains domain models for security operations and for the sdlc it pushes security and privacy risk to the the developer environment directly in likewise to configuration management, and there's a continuous test environment that moves to security not just for a code scans but for things like weather

[56:09.700 - 56:31.600]
Firewall ports get opened and closed and whether containers are spun up and shut down when they're supposed to be and also pushes the test case authoring more to the the application side. So those are kind of principles from devops and left shift, but they are pushed into the the safety standard. So now I want to show you a

[56:33.200 - 56:35.100]
word file if I can get to it.

[56:37.700 - 56:38.100]
Yeah.

[56:47.800 - 56:53.000]
Actually, I'll just look for the at the appendix.

[57:10.100 - 57:11.600]
Thinking about it.

[57:16.300 - 57:21.400]
So I can let me jump to it.

[57:41.500 - 57:45.800]
Maybe we could do with page numbers had this up earlier.

[57:54.700 - 57:59.000]
Why don't we go to questions? Oh, here it is. All right. I was about to give up.

[58:01.500 - 58:05.400]
Screen hasn't refreshed at Chris.

[58:09.200 - 58:14.300]
This is why don't I hear it is now. Can you see it?

[58:16.500 - 59:16.100]
All right, great. Thanks. Right. So what we this is basically the safety level so this this might be of interest. So we you know try to identify. You know, what we think are the key points to improve safety and and believe me. This was a tough sell even within our small group because when we tried to analogize the fact that the safety process in aviation is one that involves a lot of non-technical and Trust related work that's sort of non-computational that seemed unlike unfamiliar territory. But that kind of is the gist of this that while there are, you know, computationally perfectible solutions to certain parts of the problems like, you know, closing a firewall port or patching say a struts module. There are other parts of this that have to do with less less easily.

[59:16.500 - 59:47.700]
Protected elements that is why Aviation is safe because the whole supply chain is involved in the process of making it safety and making things safe. So, you know the risk management and safety approach to this is is a bit novel in the security space even though really it's kind of an obvious thing. So the facets of this would be, you know, human touch points apis with the application models look like authority to collect data.

[59:48.600 - 59:52.500]
Whether you've got a communicator for the fabric.

[59:53.700 - 59:56.100]
Whether you have forensics playbooks.

[59:57.200 - 01:00:05.400]
The business continuity capacity management for security operations how you manage consent and traceability for consent?

[01:00:06.300 - 01:00:23.500]
Continuous delivery for security and privacy components where you maintain and Export your dependency and Federation models disaster planning and information sharing interoperability for the domain model.

[01:00:24.200 - 01:00:48.600]
So I'm not going to read all these so these are obviously not exclusive there. The attempt is just to pick some of the the key elements that we think will contribute to safety. So I'll stop here and take questions this I know we're covering a lot of ground here. But this document, you know, you can download it and we can talk about it in another meeting if it's of interest to this group.

[01:00:50.900 - 01:00:56.100]
This is great. It would be good to add a link to the notes in the question already. Got it.

[01:00:56.800 - 01:00:58.700]
Sure, I'll do that, too.

[01:00:59.800 - 01:01:39.500]
Here we go. No, I think Kristen got it already. So yeah, I'm an sounded. Yeah, echoing threes comments in the chat here would be fantastic to make sure that we capture in the minutes a link to this presentation and the docks assuming there's somewhere public on the new internet or can be made. So if not, I can find a place to host it this was make to order job. So I'll put a link to it in the in the Google Doc fantastic.

[01:01:41.000 - 01:01:58.500]
We're at times almost like everyone's time. But if anyone wants to stay, you know minute or so over open up the questions for Mark. You don't have to leave. Thank you for coming apologies for not using the time, right?

[01:02:03.400 - 01:03:03.300]
So my question mark you mentioned that your peer at nist had additional context that was relevant to this group. Shall I allocate time? Yeah, I was lucky. He was a little fuzzy about what his commitment was in April. He was trying to ask for time in April without naming the date. So I need to nail him down but he's a he's a cryptology PhD at Fujitsu. And so he's on top of the blockchain stuff and some other things that might be of interest and you know, the cryptology stuff enters into a lot of this Federation and trust issues in kind of Insidious ways and people have some unrealistic expectations about that. And so there's that topic at all. So the, you know, the compute the problem of computing on encrypted data is worth catching up with so that's that's still it's still a bit in

[01:03:03.400 - 01:04:03.300]
In the future planning, but he's current on the work in that so I think yeah, I think would be great to have him here. Great. Well, we are barreling towards a presentation at the cognitive Computing Foundation Toc teksu technical oversight committee. Sorry break down my acronyms and on the 17th of April, so I believe will probably need to focus in the coming weeks on preparation for that right making sure that it that, you know, everyone's aligned all the ducks in a row and we're ready to put our case in front of the TOC and get approval so we can begin operating officially as a CN CF working group. So let's let's set that aside for now.

[01:04:03.400 - 01:05:02.900]
And come back and potentially have that as a discussion for some date later than the 17th of April which I believe is a Tuesday and that probably means that the earliest date we could consider would be not that Friday because I'd like to debrief with everybody the 27th would be the earliest. Okay? Okay. Sure. Excellent. All right. Well, thank you Mark and thank you Ray for sharing excited about the the white pepper document that's getting rolling over the course of this next week. If team members here can have a look at that and I'd really love to get some of those footnotes put in about

[01:05:03.300 - 01:05:14.400]
This thing that, you know called this and that and kubernetes and whatnot. I think that will go a long way to helping support that. Thanks everybody. Talk to you next week. Thank you.
