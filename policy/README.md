# CNCF SIG Security policy team introduction

## Background

When SAFE WG was originally proposed, developers from Kubernetes Policy WG
actively participated the discussions and then proposed CNCF level Policy WG was
[merged](/policy-wg-merging.md) with SAFE WG to form the current CNCF SIG
Security, in alignment with the SIG [charter](/governance/charter.md).

## Team

The policy team in CNCF SIG Security consists of the same set of developers that
forms the [Kubernetes Policy WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-policy). 
The only difference is the topic coverage (whether it is at Kubernetes level or
CNCF level).

The team leads are responsible for hosting meetings and manage necessary
logitics needed for the team development, and identified as part of the sig
[project team leads](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security#policy-team).
The policy team is under the overall [governance](/governance/roles.md) of the
CNCF SIG Security and should not be viewed as a separate entity. All policy
related contributions are welcomed to be made to the sig-security repo if needed
.

## Work
One of the major output of the team effort is the [cloud native policy
white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StDYW1zHVSF1Qswk0ScsyKw766AbAHOikyCNtqCsMMY/edit?usp=sharing)

The current top priority development work are 
- [Policy Formal Verification](/policy/overview-policy-formal-verification.md)
- [Policy Violation CRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJWcaJdo8w88tIixiZp9zBMHKghTMrHTyHyk6xcoVhk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Contact
The team can be reached via either Kubernetess slack channel #wg-policy or
