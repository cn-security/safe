Instituting observability and metrics into cloud native architectures delivers security insights so appropriate
stakeholders can resolve and mitigate anomalies appearing in reporting; tools in this area can help collect and
visualize this information. Through the use of behavioral and heuristic analysis teams can detect and escalate outliers,
suspicious events, and unexplained calls to appropriate stakeholders. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),
or statistical modeling are all mechanisms that are encouraged to assist in behavioral and heuristic analysis development.
