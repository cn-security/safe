## New Members

New members are advised to:

* Join the [CNCF Slack team](https://slack.cncf.io/), particulary [#sig-security](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/CDJ7MLT8S) channel and introduce yourself.
* Initially go through the following documents in the repository:
	* [README.md](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/README.md) 
	* [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
	* [usecases.md](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/usecases.md)
* Regularly join the [Zoom meeting](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/blob/master/README.md#meeting-time) atleast for the first couple of months to get yourself upto speed. 
* Here are multiple ways to get involved:
	* Join the meeting as advised above and express your area of interests or if you want to work on any specific issue.
	* Express your thoughts or ask questions on an issue you find interesting.
	* Choose an issue where [help is needed](https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/labels/help%20wanted) and comment on it expressing interest. 

Peer support:

* Every new member will be assigned a buddy preferably in the same time zone.
* The buddy will help in identifying the new member's areas of interest thus assigning them to the right peer group. 

Purpose of this plan:

* Ensure you become familiar with the team, know how you will contribute and what you will learn and deliver.
